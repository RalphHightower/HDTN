 *
 * This BpSendPacketRunner class is used for launching the BpSendPacket class into its own process.
 * The BpSendPacketRunner provides a blocking Run function which creates and
 * initializes a BpSendPacket object by processing/using the various command line arguments.
 * BpSendPacketRunner also provides a signal handler listener to capture Ctrl+C (SIGINT) events
 * for clean termination.
